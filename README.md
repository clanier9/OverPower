OverPower
=========

This is OverPower Online. 

OverPower is a collectible card game featuring comic book heros and villains that I used to play as a kid. I found that there was an online community of people who still play and that there was also a digital version of the game available. Upon playing this version, I found it very buggy and badly outdated. I decided to see if I had the ability to edit the code and make the online version of the game better. I found that it was made using Visual Basic and attained the go ahead from the orignal creators to make edits. I found the code completely unreadable to me, so I quickly abandoned this quest and decided to see if I could make the game from scratch.

I chose Visual Studio as my IDE because of how easy it was to create and manipulate GUIs. I got very far in the process. In fact, I even played a game over a manual peer to peer network with someone located in Canada while I was in California. As I progressed in my classes and learned more about Computer Science, I realized that I could have done many things better. There was also a slight outcry from the online OverPower community to have my new and improved game be playable on both PC and Mac. These reasons are primarily what led me to abandon the project and start over using Java. This is that Java version. You can find the old Visual Studio OverPower Online and OverPower Online Game Server projects in my 'Deprecated' respository.
